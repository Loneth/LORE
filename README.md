It's just working with grabbing shops at this moment, I really do not have time to finish LORE™ on this week, so I'm releasing this like a ***spoiler what it's will be soon as possible***.

I want to ask to dont shit talk, because it's in still developing.
You are free to use and make other versions, but I wanna the Lore's name has keep.

## HOW TO USE? ##
The coolest thing in LORE is the easily dynamic to use, a good example to *grab* a shop is typing a Shop ID in the text area ***"load shop"***  and next click in the ***GET Shop*** button or if you wanna grab a shop without ID you just need open *any shop* and click in the ***GET Shop*** button, when you click in this button LORE™ is ready to copy to your clipboard the SQL code of the shop *(because of the majority of the community the SQL standardized is mEXT Maou V3)*, you just need click the copy button to do.
